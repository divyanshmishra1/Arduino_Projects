**Project 1: Traffic Lights System with Pedestrian Crossing**
Welcome to the Traffic Lights System project repository! This project simulates a traffic light system for cars and pedestrians using Arduino Uno.

**Overview**
This project replicates a standard traffic lights system with additional pedestrian crossing signals. It includes LEDs for car traffic lights (green, yellow, red), pedestrian traffic lights (green, red), and a push button to control pedestrian signals.

**Components Needed**
Arduino Uno
3 x LEDs (Red, Yellow, Green) for car traffic lights
2 x LEDs (Red, Green) for pedestrian traffic lights
1 x Pushbutton for pedestrian control
Resistors
Breadboard
Jumper wires

**Instructions**
Setting Up the Circuit:
Connect Components:

Connect the LEDs and pushbutton to the Arduino as per the circuit diagram.
Upload Arduino Sketch:

Upload the provided Arduino sketch to control the traffic lights and pedestrian signals.
How It Works:
Car Traffic Lights:

Green LED: Allows cars to proceed.
Yellow LED: Warns cars to prepare to stop.
Red LED: Stops cars from moving.
Pedestrian Traffic Lights:

Green LED: Allows pedestrians to cross.
Red LED: Signals pedestrians to stop.
Pushbutton:

Mimics a pedestrian request button.
Pressing the button activates the pedestrian green light after the car green light turns red.
